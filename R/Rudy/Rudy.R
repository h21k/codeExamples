#### DESCRIBING THE DATA #####

# are we getting in terms of the numbers of errors that people make.BARCHART

ErrCount <- table(NEData$ErrorsTotal)
#List of Values and number of times it was answered:
ErrCount

#Now we feed this into a barchart

barplot(ErrCount, main="Barplot of Total Number of Errors")

#not often that people make exactly the same number of errors

#barplots are better for nominal variables

barplot(NEData$cheerful, main="How many ppl were cheerful")

#BACK to ERRORS TOTAL -  Histogram
                          
hist(NEData$ErrorsTotal)             
#help(hist) lots more parameters
                          
                          
#For numbers total

#Now we can summarize the data:
summary(ErrorData)

#we are really interested in the difference in errors between conditions
#Also, standard deviation is always useful 
#(even when the data isnâ€™t necessarily normally distributed
#For this we need the dinction describe
describe(ErrorData)

#So we are getting an error its in the Psych library
                          
install.packages("psych") or show the other way & activate

#Now we can summarize (compare means and standart deviations to the histograms)
describe(ErrorData)
                          
#Need visibility on IAC so we group the data by conditions - differences in means?

#numbers are hard to interpret. A graph is better - Boxplot!
                          
boxplot(ErrorsTotal~Condition, data=ErrorData)
boxplot(NumbersTotal~Condition, data=ErrorData)
boxplot(Corrections~Condition, data=ErrorData)
#is the difference comparable to the size of the boxes? if so sign diff! 
                          
#You can also produce boxplots for more than one factor
boxplot(ErrorsTotal~Condition * Sex, data = ErrorData)
                          
#Now Speed accuracy tradeoff?
plot(NEData$ErrorsTotal,NEData$NumbersTotal)
                          
#can also add a regression line which is an indicator 
#of the linear relationship between the two variables

#We could go on looking into more discriptives
